Upgrading

You cannot skip major versions when upgrading. If you are upgrading from version 0.90.x to 0.94.x, you must first go from 0.90.x to 0.92.x and then go from 0.92.x to 0.94.x.

It may be possible to skip across versions — for example go from 0.92.2 straight to 0.98.0 just following the 0.96.x upgrade instructions — but these scenarios are untested.
